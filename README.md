# Skateboard quiz

homework 4

DESCRIPTION:

In my program you start at the start screen. Once you click the start button, a timer for 53 seconds begins and you are prompted with a series of 4 multiple choice questions to be completed in the given time or the screen will "hide". If you guess correctly the back ground turns green, if wrong red. The answers will also change color based on correct or false. Once you select an answer you must hit the next button to continue on to the next question.

CHALLENGES:

unfortunately this was quite challenging for me. As you can see i was unable to complete the assignment due to being unable to get the score card created or the ability to log the scores and initals into local storage. another problem i faced was designating two functions to the answer buttons so that the next question would appear once clicked. i also had issues when it came to reseting the counter and score variable. Have mercy on my soul
